# what is  Artificial Intelligence?  

 Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision.


# How does AI work?

As the hype around AI has accelerated, vendors have been scrambling to promote how their products and services use AI. Often what they refer to as AI is simply one component of AI, such as machine learning. AI requires a foundation of specialized hardware and software for writing and training machine learning algorithms. No one programming language is synonymous with AI, but a few, including Python, R and Java, are popular.

In general, AI systems work by ingesting large amounts of labeled training data, analyzing the data for correlations and patterns, and using these patterns to make predictions about future states. In this way, a chatbot that is fed examples of text chats can learn to produce lifelike exchanges with people, or an image recognition tool can learn to identify and describe objects in images by reviewing millions of examples.

AI programming focuses on three cognitive skills: learning, reasoning and self-correction.

Learning processes. This aspect of AI programming focuses on acquiring data and creating rules for how to turn the data into actionable information. The rules, which are called algorithms, provide computing devices with step-by-step instructions for how to complete a specific task

# Why  Artificial Intelligence is important ?

 AI is important because it can give enterprises insights into their operations that they may not have been aware of previously and because, in some cases, AI can perform tasks better than humans. Particularly when it comes to repetitive, detail-oriented tasks like analyzing large numbers of legal documents to ensure relevant fields are filled in properly, AI tools often complete jobs quickly and with relatively few errors.

This has helped fuel an explosion in efficiency and opened the door to entirely new business opportunities for some larger enterprises. Prior to the current wave of AI, it would have been hard to imagine using computer software to connect riders to taxis, but today Uber has become one of the largest companies in the world by doing just that. It utilizes sophisticated machine learning algorithms to predict when people are likely to need rides in certain areas, which helps proactively get drivers on the road before they're needed. As another example, Google has become one of the largest players for a range of online services by using machine learning to understand how people use their services and then improving them. In 2017, the company's CEO, Sundar Pichai, pronounced that Google would operate as an "AI first" company.

# What an Artificial Intelligence Engineer Actually Does

* An artificial intelligence engineer conceptualizes, designs, builds and finally rolls out sophisticated machine learning algorithms that facilitate autonomous knowledge gathering through unstructured training sets (deep learning) besides the deployment of the AI models in real-world production setups. 

*AI engineers also set up the basis of intelligent automation processes using proprietary or third-party tools within the enterprise. Other functions include researching and recommendations on improvements in existing machine learning algorithms, SDLC based machine learning implementation on a dataset to train the model, data mining, pattern recognition and training of the AI model, and the training of ML-based algos for domain-specific functions.



# What an Artificial Intelligence Engineer is Required to Know

AI engineers are expected to be problem solvers. Their perspectives need to go beyond the ordinary observations and statistical thinking, logical reasoning and solution. However, education is as important as the soft skills. Typically, a Bachelor’s degree is required in Computer Science, Mathematics or statistics. But what is crucial, however, is the understanding and comfort level with ideating and solving problems in all three. To tabulate:

Computer Sciences

Information Technology

Mathematics

Statistics (the most preferred component outside of computer science in education)

*Technical skills*
AI is a technology platform, and technical it must get at some point. Thorough working knowledge of programming concepts, (especially object-oriented) lays the foundation for your entire technical skillset. Almost all would agree with Python being the language of choice of AI development models worldwide. But it doesn't end there. Coupled with programming languages, some specific areas of mathematics and statistics are also a part of the must-have mix.

These Include, But are Not Limited to:

Python - The darling of AI engineers worldwide, Python is widely regarded as one of the easiest programs to learn, combined with some of the most advanced capabilities in solving machine learning and artificial intelligence problems. Python comes with libraries and code snippets that can be easily implemented for the most complex tasks. These include NumPy, PyTorch and a whole host of others.

Java - While not as popular as Python in AI, java is a widely used programming language and its DL4J (Deep Learning 4 Java) library is today among the most popular enterprise machine learning solutions. In fact, it is popular among students as well, for its ease of use.

R - The originally statistical programming language is increasingly becoming popular for handling large datasets and scaling up AI in enterprises worldwide. R packages for AI include Keras, Infer and a whole host of others.
