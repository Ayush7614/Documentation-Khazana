Go language is a programming language initially developed at Google in the year 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. 
It is a statically-typed language having syntax similar to that of C. 
It provides garbage collection, type safety, dynamic-typing capability, many advanced built-in types such as variable length arrays and key-value maps. 
It also provides a rich standard library. The Go programming language was launched in November 2009 and is used in some of the Google's production systems.
